            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Nikola Tesla inventions constitute numerous technological breakthroughs throughout his lifetime. Born in Smiljan, Croatia, in 1856, the math and physics genius contributed innovations that continue to impact our lives daily today. He held over three hundred patents, but was only recognized for some, indicating many of his ideas were tested and failed or never became well known.
                In 1882, upon graduation from the Technical University of Graz and Philosophy at the University of Prague, he drew the first sketches of his idea to build an electromagnetic motor. His first job entailed retailing DC power plants for ConEd which led to his immigration to the states in 1884.
